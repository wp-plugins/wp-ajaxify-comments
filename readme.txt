WP-Ajaxify-Comments hooks into your current theme and adds AJAX functionality to the comment form.

== Description ==

When submitting the comment form, WordPress by default reloads the complete page. In case of an error (e.g. an invalid e-mail address or an empty comment field) the error message is shown on top of a new (blank) screen and the user has to use the browser's back button to correct the comment form and post the comment again. The WP-Ajaxify-Comments WordPress plugin hooks into any WordPress theme and adds AJAX functionality to the comment form: When the comment form is submitted, the plugin sends the data to the WordPress backend without reloading the entire page. In case of an error, the plugin shows a popup overlay containing the error message. If the comment was posted successfully, the plugin adds the (new) comment to the list of existing comments without leaving the page and shows an info overlay popup.

Since the plugin hooks (on client-side) into the theme to intercept the submit of the comment form and to add new comments without reloading the page, the plugin needs to access the DOM nodes using (jQuery) selectors. The plugin comes with default values for these selectors that were successfully tested with WordPress' default themes "Twenty Ten" or "Twenty Eleven". If the plugin does not work out of the box with your theme, custom selectors could be defined in the WordPress admin frontend (see FAQ).

Summarized the WP-Ajaxify-Comments plugin hooks into your theme and improves the usability of the comment form by validating and adding comments without the need of complete page reloads.

== Screenshots ==

1. Info popup overlay after the comment has successfully been posted
2. Error popup overlay with error message when posting a comment failed

== Installation ==

1. Upload wp-ajaxify-comments.zip to your WordPress plugins directory, usually `wp-content/plugins/` and unzip the file. It will create a `wp-content/plugins/wp-ajaxify-comments/` directory.
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
1. Enable the plugin on the plugin's settings page (Settings > WP-Ajaxify-Comments)

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= The plugin is not working, what can I do? =

It is recommended to use the plugin's debug mode that could be enabled on the plugin's settings page ("Settings > WP-Ajaxify-Comments"). After enabling the debug mode use a browser that supports console.log(...), e.g., Firefox with the Firebug extension or Google Chrome and open a page that contains a comment form. If the plugin is not working you most likley find an error message in the console saying that one of the selectors does not match any element.
If your theme does not use the default IDs for the comment form (`#commentform`), the comment container (`#comments`) or the respond container (`#respond`) you need to go to the plugins settings page and provide the proper selectors.

Last but not least: The plugin is still in a prototype state, so there could be some bugs. Please do not hesitate to <a href="http://blog.janjonas.net/contact">contact me</a> or to use the <a href="http://wordpress.org/support/plugin/wp-ajaxify-comments">support forum</a>, if you have problems to get the plugin working.

= Are there any known problems? =

There are problems when using an old jQuery version. The plugin was successfully tested with jQuery 1.4.4.

The debugging mode does not work in Internet Explorer; please use Firebug or Google Chrome for debugging wp-ajaxify-comments.

= Does this plugin work with every WordPress theme? =

Since the plugin hooks into the DOM that is generated by the theme, there is no guarantee that the plugin works with every theme.
Basically the theme needs to support a container element that wraps all comments and a comment form and these two elements need to be selectable by a (jQuery) selector. Please go to the plugin's settings page to customize these selectors if the default selectors do not match the elements in your theme.

= Does the plugin work with older WordPress versions than 3.1.3? =

Most likely yes, but it has not been tested yet. Please leave me a message if you have trouble using the plugin with older Worpress versions and I will try to update the plugin to add compatibility.

= Are there any future plans? =

Yes, there are some features I would like to add in future versions:

* Internationalization (i18n) and localization (L10n)
* More options to customize the look and feel
* Client-side validation

= How to enable the debug mode? =

The debug mode can be enabled on the plugin's settings page (Settings > WP-Ajaxify-Comments).

= Does the plugin use any external libraries? =

Yes, the plugin uses jQuery blockUI plugin (http://malsup.com/jquery/block/) to block the UI while the comment is sent to the server and to show popup overlays containing the error and info messages.
