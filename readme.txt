WP-Ajaxify-Comments hooks into your comment form and adds AJAX functionality - no page reloads required when validating, posting or updating comments

== Description ==

When submitting the comment form, WordPress by default reloads the complete page. In the case of an error (e.g. an invalid e-mail address or an empty comment field) the error message is shown on top of a new (blank) screen and the user has to use the browser's back button to correct the comment form and post the comment again. The WP-Ajaxify-Comments WordPress plugin hooks into any WordPress theme and adds AJAX functionality to the comment form: When the comment form is submitted, the plugin sends the data to the WordPress backend without reloading the entire page. In the case of an error, the plugin shows a popup overlay containing the error message and the user can correct the comment form without navigating back. If the comment was posted successfully, the plugin adds the (new) comment to the list of existing comments without leaving the page and shows an information overlay popup. 
Moreover this plugin includes an option to automatically refresh the comments on the current page (if the user is "idle") without a page reload. 

**Live demo:** You can try out a live demo in <a target="_blank" href="http://blog.janjonas.net/2012-06-08/wordpress-ajax-comment-wp-ajaxify-comments-plugin">the blog post I've written for the initial release of the plugin</a>. 

Since the plugin hooks (on client-side) into the theme to intercept the comment form submit process, and to add new comments without reloading the page, the plugin needs to access the DOM nodes using (jQuery) selectors. The plugin comes with default values for these selectors that were successfully tested with WordPress' default themes "Twenty Ten", "Twenty Eleven", "Twenty Twelve", "Twenty Thirteen", "Twenty Fourteen". 

Summarized, the WP-Ajaxify-Comments plugin hooks into your theme and improves the usability of the comment form by validating and adding comments without the need of complete page reloads.

**Important:** If the plugin does not work out of the box with your theme, custom selectors could be defined in the plugin's admin frontend. If you don't succeed in configuring the proper selectors please don't hesitate to ask a question in the <a href="http://wordpress.org/support/plugin/wp-ajaxify-comments">plugin's support forum</a> or <a href="http://blog.janjonas.net/contact" target="_blank">send me a private message</a>. The plugin is highly customizable and *I'm aware of only a few conflicts with any themes or other plugins that cannot be resolved* (see "Known incompatibilities" in the FAQ section). I would kindly ask you make a <a href="http://blog.janjonas.net/donate" target="_blank">small (PayPal) donation</a> when I'm able to find a working configuration for your customized WordPress page. All donations will secure future development and support of the plugin. Thanks in advance! You can find more troubleshooting information on the <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-ajaxify-comments/faq/">FAQ page</a>.

== Screenshots ==

1. Info popup overlay after the comment has successfully been posted
2. Error popup overlay with error message when posting a comment failed
3. Admin frontend (to customize the plugin)

== Installation ==

1. Upload wp-ajaxify-comments.zip to your WordPress plugins directory, usually `wp-content/plugins/` and unzip the file. It will create a `wp-content/plugins/wp-ajaxify-comments/` directory.
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
1. Enable the plugin on the plugin's settings page (Settings > WP-Ajaxify-Comments)

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= The plugin is not working, what can I do? =

It is recommended to use the plugin's debug mode that can be enabled on the plugin's settings page ("Settings > WP-Ajaxify-Comments"). After enabling the debug mode use a browser that supports console.log(&hellip;) e.g. Firefox with the Firebug extension or Google Chrome and open a page that contains a comment form. If the plugin is not working you will most likely find an error message in the console saying that one of the selectors does not match any element.
If your theme does not use the default IDs for the comment form (`#commentform`), the comment container (`#comments`) or the respond container (`#respond`) you need to go to the plugins settings page and provide the proper selectors.

**Please note:** If you don't succeed in configuring the proper selectors, please don't hesitate to ask a question the <a target="_blank" href="http://wordpress.org/support/plugin/wp-ajaxify-comments">plugin's support forum</a> or <a href="http://blog.janjonas.net/contact" target="_blank">send me a private message</a>. The plugin is highly customizable and *I'm not aware of conflicts to any themes or other plugins that cannot be resolved*. I would kindly ask you make a <a href="http://blog.janjonas.net/donate" target="_blank">small (PayPal) donation</a> when I'm able to find a working configuration for your customized WordPress site. All donations save future development and support of the plugin. Thanks in advance!

= Can I suggest new features? =

If you feel something is missing, or if you have any other suggestions, please <a href="http://blog.janjonas.net/contact" target="_blank" >contact me</a> or use the <a href="http://wordpress.org/support/plugin/wp-ajaxify-comments">support forum</a>.

= Are there any known problems? =

There are problems when using an old jQuery version. The plugin was successfully tested with jQuery 1.4.4 and above.

The debugging mode does not work in Internet Explorer 8 (and older versions); please use Firebug, Google Chrome or Internet Explorer 9 or above for debugging WP-Ajaxify-Comments.

Please see also the "Known incompatibilities" section.

= Does this plugin work with every WordPress theme? =

Since the plugin hooks into the DOM that is generated by the theme, there is no guarantee that the plugin will work with every theme.
Basically, the plugin uses (jQuery) selectors to find the elements like the comment form and the list of comments. Please go to the plugin's settings page to customize these selectors if the default selectors don't match the elements in your theme.

There is no guarantee, but (as written above) the plugin is highly customizable and I'm only aware of a few conflicts to any themes or other plugins that cannot be resolved (see section "Known incompatibilities" below).

= Can I add or update translations? =

If you would like to support the plugin by adding or updating translations please contact me. After installing the plugin, you can find more information about translations in the file `wp-content\plugins\wp-ajaxify-comments\languages\readme.txt`.

= Does the plugin work with older WordPress versions than 3.1.3? =

Most likely yes, but it has not been tested yet. Please leave me a message if you have trouble using the plugin with older Worpress versions and I will try to update the plugin to add compatibility.

= Are there any future plans? =

Yes, there are some features I would like to add in future versions:

* Client-side validation
* Option to enable vertical alignment of popup overlays
* Option to customize popup overlays with user-defined CSS
* File upload support

= How to enable the debug mode? =

The debug mode can be enabled on the plugin's settings page (Settings > WP-Ajaxify-Comments).

= Which callback options are supported and how do I use them? =

The plugin provides some JavaScript callback options that can be used to add custom JavaScript code that is executed on client-side when certain (wp-ajaxify-comments related) events occure. Please note that these callbacks are client-side callbacks, i.e. you cannot execute any PHP code using this callback options.

In detail the following callbacks are supported:

* OnBeforeSelectElements: Called before the plugin selects any DOM elements. The DOM tree the plugin is currently working on is passed as parameter `dom`.
* OnBeforeSubmitComment: Called before a (new) comment is submitted.
* OnBeforeUpdateComments: Called before the plugin replaces the comments.
* OnAfterUpdateComments: Called after the plugin has replaced the comments.

= How do I use the client-side API? =

In addition to the callback options the plugin provides a JavaScript client-side API that supports the following functions:

* `WPAC.RefreshComments(options)`: Refreshes the comments on the current page
* `WPAC.LoadComments(url, options)`: Loads the comments from another url/page

The options defined as key/value pairs and the following keys are supported:

* `scrollToAnchor`: Whether or not to scroll to the anchor of the target url/page (default: true)
* `showLoadingInfo`: Whether or not to show a "loading" overlay popup (default: true)
* `updateUrl`: Whether or not to update the browser url (default: false if option "Disable URL updating" is enabled, true otherwise)
* `success`: A function to be called when the comments have been updated/replaced

= Does the plugin use any external libraries? =

Yes, the plugin uses the following libraries:

* jQuery blockUI plugin (http://malsup.com/jquery/block/) to block the UI while the comment is sent to the server and to show popup overlays containing the error and info messages 
* jsuri (http://code.google.com/p/jsuri/) for query string manipulation
* jQuery Idle Timer plugin (https://github.com/mikesherov/jquery-idletimer) to detect when the user is "idle"
* jQuery Waypoints (http://imakewebthings.com/jquery-waypoints/) to detect scrolling to an element

= Known incompatibilities =

There are known incompatibilities to the following plugins:

* WP-reCAPTCHA (tested with WP-reCAPTCHA 3.1.6)
* Jetpack with activated "Jetpack Comments"
